# 🧠 Unsupervised Machine Learning: Clustering, Anomaly Detection, Recommendations, and Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains my work from the Coursera course **"Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning"** offered by **DeepLearning.AI** and taught by **Andrew Ng**.

## 📘 Course Overview

This course is part of the **Machine Learning Specialization** and explores the key areas of **Unsupervised Learning** and **Reinforcement Learning**, including:

- **Clustering** (K-Means)
- **Anomaly Detection** (Gaussian distribution, thresholding)
- **Recommendation Systems** (Collaborative Filtering, Matrix Factorization)
- **Reinforcement Learning (Intro)** (Agents, Rewards, States)
- **Optimization** (Cost functions, Gradient Descent)
- **Feature Engineering & Normalization**

## 🧠 What I Learned

- 🌀 Implemented the **K-Means** algorithm from scratch and visualized clusters.
- 🚨 Built an **Anomaly Detection** system using multivariate Gaussian models.
- 🎯 Developed a **Recommendation System** using collaborative filtering.
- 🤖 Gained a foundational understanding of **Reinforcement Learning**.
- 🛠 Applied **feature scaling** and **mean normalization** for better model performance.
- 🧮 Used vectorized operations with **NumPy** for efficient computations.

## 🧪 Tools & Libraries

- Python 🐍  
- NumPy 📘  
- Matplotlib 📊  
- Jupyter Notebook 📒
